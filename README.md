# OpenSDP Dataviz Tutorial (R)
# Plotly + R Shiny

This example tutorial will teach you how to use Plotly and Shiny in R to create
interactive data visualizations. The first part of the tutorial is interactive
and uses the [learnr R package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) to teach you
plotly in your web browser or RStudio viewer. In the second part of the
tutorial, switch to opening the numbered .R files in RStudio. You can still
follow along in the tutorial for the second half.

## Set Up

1. [Download](https://cran.r-project.org/) and install R.

2. [Download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/) and install RStudio. Make sure you have the
latest versions!

3. Inside RStudio go to Tools -> Install Packages and install `learnr`, `plotly`,
`shiny`, `shinythemes`, and all dependencies. If the install of any of the packages
fails because of dependencies, be sure to search for and install the dependency,
then try to install the package again. If you have any of these packages
already, be sure to update them.

4. If you are getting this tutorial from the Github, download (zip file) or clone
this repository. If you have downloaded it from the OpenSDP website, unzip and
extract the files.

5. Open the plotly_shiny_tutorial_v2.md file in RStudio and hit the green arrow
where it says "Run Document."

6. After finishing the first part of the tutorial, open a new RStudio instance
and open the .R files to work on the second part of the tutorial on Shiny.
You can still follow along in the tutorial.
